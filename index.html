<h1>Largest US State Exports</h1>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_exports_and_imports" target="_blank">Data Source</a>
    <div>   Story: I asked "what is the largest export from each US State?" To answer
            this I listed all the top state exports in the US and showed how many states
            leading export is this item. This allows a broad overview; seeing what the US
            is making generally. We add some further details and context to this with our
            map that shows which state has which resource as it's leading export. This can
            help us to identify regional trends and see things in another context than simply
            bars representing a count.
